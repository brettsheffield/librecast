The usual:

 make
 make install

If you want to skip running the tests, which require docker, do the above directly in the src/ directory. ie.

 cd src
 make
 make install

Prerequisites:
 libbridge from bridge-utils

 I've turned this into a shared library.  Install as follows:
 git clone https://github.com/brettsheffield/bridge-utils
 cd bridge-utils
 autoconf
 /configure --prefix=/ --libdir=/usr/lib64 --includedir=/usr/include --with-linux-headers=/usr/include
 cd libbridge
 make
 make install
